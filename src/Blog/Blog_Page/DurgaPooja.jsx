                        Durga Puja is the annual Hindu festival celebrating Goddess Durga’s victory over the buffalo demon, Mahishasura. This grand festival is observed with devotion and enthusiasm across India, particularly in West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, and Odisha.

                        In astrology, Durga Puja is performed during Navratri, which falls in the lunar month of Ashwin (September-October). This period holds high astrological importance due to the following reasons:
                        <br /><br />
                        Planetary Alignments: The Navratri period is marked by special planetary alignments that enhance spiritual energies. The sun, moon, and other celestial bodies transit through auspicious zodiac signs, amplifying the impact of prayers and rituals.
                        <br /><br />
                        Favourable Time for New Beginnings: The festival is observed during the waxing phase of the moon (Shukla Paksha), symbolising the growing positive energy. Astrologically, this is an ideal time for starting new ventures, seeking divine intervention for success, and overcoming obstacles.
                        <br /><br />
                        Protection Against Malefic Planets: Worshipping Durga during Navratri can help mitigate the negative effects of malefic planets like Saturn (Shani), Rahu, and Ketu. Devotees often seek protection from the goddess to minimize the impact of planetary transits or doshas in their birth charts.

                        Astrologers often recommend Durga Puja as a remedy for various planetary afflictions. Here’s how it helps:
                        <br /><br />For Shani Dosh (Saturn Affliction): Those undergoing Shani Sade Sati or having Saturn-related problems in their horoscope are encouraged to worship Durga, as she provides the strength to overcome challenges.
                        <br /><br />For Rahu and Ketu’s Impact: The shadow planets Rahu and Ketu can bring unexpected obstacles and confusion. By performing Durga Puja, devotees can shield themselves from these malefic effects, bringing clarity and stability.
                        <br /><br />
                        For Professional Growth: Astrologers recommend performing special rituals and pujas for professionals facing delays, financial issues, or career stagnation. Invoking Goddess Durga’s blessings during Navratri can enhance the chances of success and prosperity.
                        <br /><br />For Overcoming Personal Challenges: Many people experience periods of turmoil due to planetary transits. Offering prayers to Durga during these times strengthens resilience and courage to face adversities with grace.

                        Ghatasthapana (Kalash Sthapana): This marks the beginning of Durga Puja and involves the establishment of a sacred vessel (kalash). Astrologically, this ritual symbolizes invoking positive energy and prosperity.
                        <br /><br />Chandi Path (Recitation of Durga Saptashati): The chanting of the Durga Saptashati or Chandi Path is considered extremely powerful during Navratri. Astrologers recommend this to remove planetary afflictions and attract divine blessings.
                        <br /><br />Kumari Puja: Worshipping young girls (Kanyas) as manifestations of the goddess is a common practice during Durga Puja. Astrologically, this ritual symbolizes the nurturing of pure, feminine energy which can help neutralize negative planetary influences.

                        Consult Your Birth Chart: Before Durga Puja, consult an astrologer to understand how the festival can benefit your specific planetary positions. They may suggest special mantras, rituals, or days for you to perform during the festival.
                        <br /><br />Chanting the Durga Mantra: Reciting the Durga Mantra daily during the nine days of Navratri helps align your energies with the cosmic forces, bringing peace and harmony to your life.
                        <br /><br />Fasting and Meditation: Fasting during Navratri is considered a spiritual practice to purify the body and mind. Astrologically, fasting helps in reducing the malefic effects of planets and strengthens your aura.
                        <br /><br />
                        Light a Ghee Lamp: Lighting a lamp with ghee in front of Goddess Durga’s idol helps attract positive energy. Astrologically, this helps strengthen the influence of the Sun in your birth chart, improving leadership qualities and self-confidence.
