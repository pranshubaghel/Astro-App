                        Astrology is an ancient kind of divination that seeks to explain how the planets, stars, and moon affect human existence. Numerous cultures worldwide use astrology, which originated in the Babylonian civilization some 2,000 BCE. The practices spread to Egypt, Greece, and Rome as they became more civilized. Thus, the fundamental idea of astrology is that a person's character, emotions, and occasionally even circumstances in life are shaped by the precise positions of these stars at the time of their birth.
                        <br /><br />
                        The twelve signs of the zodiac—Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces—are the fundamental symbols of astrology. These signs are thought to govern specific behavioral patterns and characteristics and are given according to the sun's position at the time of the individual's birth. However, astrology is not limited to the sun sign and also involves the moon, planets as well as other aspects such as the ascendant sign which each makes up an intricate birth or natal chart.
