                    Astrology evolved as a reliable predictive science based on the realization that celestial objects strongly influence people's lives. Studying these heavenly bodies can reveal a lot about human beings, their characteristics, fortunes, and future. To understand and perfect this science, it took India's yogis and Siddhas years of meticulous observation of the positioning and movements of the cosmic entities like the stars and planets and linking them with the events of the world and the people's fortunes. Thus evolved the highly dependable and widely followed forecasting system of astrology.

                            Astrology operates on the principle that the positioning of the planets at the time of birth of a person virtually decides the course of their lives and fortunes. Hence, these planets were plotted accordingly in a uniquely designed chart known as the natal chart, birth chart, or <span style={{ color: "blue", opacity: "0.8" }}>horoscope</span> . The natural zodiac comprises 12 signs, known as the zodiac signs, and is represented by the 12 sections of the horoscope. The planets as found placed in the sky at the birth time are plotted in these sections, known as the Houses, and it is this horoscope, the replica of the celestial map at the time of birth, which is analyzed to make predictions about the person concerned.

                            According to the ancient Vedic Astrology system, there are nine planets, the Grahas, which include the self-luminary Sun, around which all the planets rotate but exclude our mother earth. These nine planets, which hold such strong sway over the people's lives, are much revered as Navagrahas. These are Surya, the Sun; Chandra, the Moon; Mangala or Chevvai, Mars; Budha, Mercury; Brihaspati or Guru, Jupiter; Shukra, Venus; Shani, Saturn, Rahu, and Ketu.<br /><br />

                            Unlike other planets, Rahu and Ketu do not have physical existence and hence are known as Chaya Graha, the shadow planets. They only represent the points of intersection of the orbits of the Sun and the Moon, where Rahu denotes the Northern node of the Moon and Ketu, the Southern node.<br /><br />

                            Some of these nine planets are regarded as auspicious or benefic, while others are inauspicious or malefic. While Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and the waxing Moon are held auspicious, the Sun, Mars, Saturn, Rahu, Ketu, and the waning Moon are considered otherwise.<br /><br />

                            The 12 horoscopic Houses, too, have their significance. The first House, called the Lagna or the Ascendant, is perhaps the most crucial and represents an individual's personality and physical features. Similarly, each of the other Houses, too, stands for a significant aspect of life.

                            Which planet is present in which House? Which planet is in conjunction with which other planet and where? Which planet casts its aspect on what House? What are the qualities of the planets placed in the various Houses? And what areas of life do those Houses represent? â€“ All these form part of the horoscope reading or analysis and forecasting about a person and their future.
